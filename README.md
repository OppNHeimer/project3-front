# GA-Aha (WDI Project 3)

Ga-Aha is a blog designed for General Assembly students to share their 'aha' moments. It was built in four days using ReactJS as our front-end library, Express to build the back-end and Mongoose for our database. We also used MaterializeCSS to streamline styling.

### Our Team
* Diona Kurien (dionadk)
* Max Oppenheimer (OppNHeimer)
* Aaliyah Melton (AaliyahMe123)
* Drew Dandrea (ddandrea00)

### Our MVP goals:
1. Users can view, create, edit, and delete posts.
2. Users can comment on posts

### Our Silver goals:
1. Users can tag posts
2. Users can filter posts by tags

### Our Gold goals:
1. Users can login using GitHub
2. Users can filter posts by GA cohort
3. Users can check local weather at GA
4. Users can see current GA events

We achieved all MVP, silver goals, and most gold goals with the exception of GitHub user authentication and current GA events.
