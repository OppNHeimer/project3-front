## Back-end Technology
3 - Includes many well-structured models, and advanced functionality such as authorization, 3rd-party API integration, or other technology not covered in class

Good job here! I like the use of timestamps.

## Front-end Technology	
3 - In addition to appropriate React use, includes 1 React topic not covered in class.

Good job! You integrated the additional API in and more CSS stuff than we had gone over. 

## Code Quality	
2 - Code is well-formatted, well-named, and contains few style / quality issues	

Overall, your code looks good. I ended up breaking App.js down into smaller components -- I would definitely look at the code there for a better breakdown. I also fixed some stylistic things throughout -- like inconsistent semi-colon use! In the future, using a linter would make it so that everyone follows similar styling!

## Deployment and Functionality	
3 - App has advanced functionality that works with minimal errors, and may make use of advanced tools such as APIs, plugins, etc. App may be deployed to a service other than Heroku (e.g. Digital Ocean).

Your app is deployed and functional!

## Planning / Process / Submission
3  - Submission includes everything in previous category, as well as evidence of proper teamwork, such as feature branching, code review, github issue / user story tracking, and justification of technical decisions.

Good job with the readme! I really, really like your use of issues to track what you were doing.

### Feedback
* Really great job on this project! It seems like you all worked together well as a team. 
* Good job creating an app with all new technologies to you! It was a big challenge but you rose to the occasion!
* I would focus on component architecture as your next step for this application
* I refactored a lot of the code -- which you can see throughout this PR and the one on the backend. The inline comments have more improvements!
* Again, great job!
